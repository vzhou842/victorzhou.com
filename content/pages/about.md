I studied Computer Science at Princeton University (Class of 2019), and I'm going to be a Software Engineer at Facebook starting in August 2019. A few of the projects I'm most known for include:

- [**generals.io**](http://generals.io) [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/generalsio), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13145781), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/generals-io)], a multiplayer browser strategy game with half a million monthly players and a [Bot API](http://dev.generals.io).
- [**faster.js**](https://github.com/vzhou842/faster.js) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16886494)], a micro-optimizing Javascript compiler.
- [**GeoArena Online**](https://geoarena.online) [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/geoarena), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/geoarena-online)], a fast-paced multiplayer browser game that had hundreds of thousands of monthly players.
