I'm currently helping build [gather.town](https://gather.town/) (we're hiring! Reach out if interested). Previously, I was a Software Engineer (SWE) at Facebook, and I've done SWE internships at Facebook (2015 and 2018), Google (2016), and Airbnb (2017). I studied Computer Science at Princeton University (Class of 2019). I've been [programming since I was 12](/blog/how-i-became-a-programmer/) and love to build things.

Some of my more well-known projects include:

- [**generals.io**](http://generals.io) [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/generalsio), [Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=generals.io), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/generals-io)], a multiplayer browser strategy game with millions of players and a [Bot API](http://dev.generals.io) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13562866)]. Sold in January 2018.
- [**Neural Networks From Scratch**](/series/neural-networks-from-scratch), a series of 4 of my most popular blog posts in which I provide a fundamentals-oriented approach towards understanding Neural Networks.
- [**easy-VQA**](/blog/easy-vqa/), a "Hello World" dataset for Visual Question Answering (VQA). Listed on the official [VQA website](https://visualqa.org/external.html).
- [**faster.js**](https://github.com/vzhou842/faster.js) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16886494)], a micro-optimizing Javascript compiler. I wrote a post titled [Avoid Premature Optimization](/blog/avoid-premature-optimization/) detailing a few things I learned from this experience.
- **GeoArena Online** _(no longer online)_ [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/geoarena), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/geoarena-online)], a fast-paced multiplayer browser game that had hundreds of thousands of monthly players. I wrote a [blog post](/blog/why-you-should-use-webpack/) about some of my experiences building GeoArena. Sold in February 2019.
- [**example-io-game**](https://example-io-game.victorzhou.com/), open-sourced to accompany my [guide to building .io games](/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/).
- [**Definitely Secure Bank**](https://dsb.victorzhou.com/), built for demo purposes as an example of common security vulnerabilities for my [Web Security](/tag/security/) posts.
- [**profanity-check**](https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18777950)], a fast, robust Python library to check for profanity in strings. [Read my blog post](/blog/better-profanity-detection-with-scikit-learn/) about this project.

I've spoken on a tech podcast about my experiences [building and selling games](/blog/creating-and-selling-io-games/) like generals.io and GeoArena.
