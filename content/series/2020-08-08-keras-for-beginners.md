[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. This 3-post series, written for beginners, provides a simple way for anyone to get started solving real machine learning problems. We’ll start with an introduction to **classic Neural Networks** for complete beginners before delving into two popular variants: **Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNNs) and **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs).

For each of each these types of networks, we’ll:

- Introduce a (simple) real-world problem
- Preprocess the dataset
- Build a model for the problem
- Train and test the model
- Brainstorm ideas to keep improving the model

At the end of each post, you'll have the full code to accomplish everything listed above.

## Background

**This series requires ZERO prior experience with Keras or Tensorflow.** However, background in the following topics may be helpful:

- [**Neural Networks**](/tag/neural-networks/) in general (how do they work, what are they for?). I recommend my [Neural Networks from Scratch](/series/neural-networks-from-scratch/) series to get started here.
- **Python** - basic familiarity with the language will help you move through the series faster.
- Experience with other deep-learning libraries, which will help you ramp up faster on Keras.

## The Series

Without further ado:
