One-Hot Encoding takes a single integer and produces a vector where **a single element is 1** and **all other elements are 0**, like $$[0, 1, 0, 0]$$.

For example, imagine we're working with **categorical data**, where only a limited number of colors are possible: red, green, or blue. One way we could represent this numerically is by assigning each color a number:

| Color | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Red | 0 |
| Green | 1 |
| Blue | 2 |

This is known as **integer encoding**. For Machine Learning, this encoding can be problematic - in this example, we're essentially saying "green" is the _average_ of "red" and "blue", which can lead to weird unexpected outcomes.

It's often more useful to use the **one-hot encoding** instead:

| Color | Integer Encoding | One-Hot Encoding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red | 0 | $$[1, 0, 0]$$ |
| Green | 1 | $$[0, 1, 0]$$ |
| Blue | 2 | $$[0, 0, 1]$$ |

This is much more useful to pass into something like a [neural network](/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/).

## One-Hot Encoding in Python

Below are several different ways to implement one-hot encoding in Python.

### scikit-learn

Using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s [OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html):

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
print(encoder.fit_transform([['red'], ['green'], ['blue']]))
'''
[[0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0.]]
 '''
```

### Keras

Using [Keras](https://keras.io/)'s [to_categorical](https://keras.io/utils/#to_categorical):

```python
from keras.utils import to_categorical

print(to_categorical([0, 1, 2]))
'''
[[1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]]
 '''
```

### NumPy

Using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

```python
import numpy as np

arr = [2, 1, 0]
max = np.max(arr) + 1
print(np.eye(max)[arr])
'''
[[0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0.]]
'''
```
