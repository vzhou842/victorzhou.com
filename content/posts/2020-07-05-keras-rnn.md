[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple [Recurrent Neural Network](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) (RNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.

This post is intended for **complete beginners to Keras** but does assume a **basic background knowledge of RNNs**. My [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) covers everything you need to know (and more) for this post - read that first if necessary.

Here we go!

## The Problem: Classifying Movie Reviews

We're going to tackle a classic introductory [Natural Language Processing](/tag/natural-language-processing/) (NLP) problem: doing sentiment analysis on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) movie reviews from Stanford AI Lab's [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

Here are two samples from the dataset:

| Excerpt from review | Sentiment |
| --- | --- |
| Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement… | Positive&nbsp;👍 |
| This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce… | Negative&nbsp;👎 |

## 1. Setup

First, we need to download the dataset. You can either:

- [download it from my site](/movie-reviews-dataset.zip) (I've hosted a copy of it that removes the extraneous files we won't need for this post), or
- [download it from the official site](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

Either way, you'll end up with a directory with the following structure:

```
dataset/
  test/
    neg/
    pos/
  train/
    neg/
    pos/
```

Next, we'll install dependencies. All we need is [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which comes packaged with Keras as its official high-level API. However, we're going to use a relatively new API in Tensorflow for this post, so you'll need to install the [tf-nightly](https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly/) package, which is released nightly and has the most recent changes:

```
$ pip install tf-nightly
```

> I'll update this post once the API we use makes it into the stable `tensorflow` package.

## 2. Preparing the Data

Tensorflow has a very easy way for us to read in our dataset: [text_dataset_from_directory](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory) (yes, this was the reason we needed `tf-nightly`). Here's how we'll do it:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import text_dataset_from_directory

# Assumes you're in the root level of the dataset directory.
# If you aren't, you'll need to change the relative paths here.
train_data = text_dataset_from_directory("./train")
test_data = text_dataset_from_directory("./test")
```

`dataset` is now a Tensorflow [Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset) object we can use later!

There's one more small thing to do. If you browse through the dataset, you'll notice that some of the reviews include `<br />` markers in them, which are [HTML line breaks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br). We want to get rid of those, so we'll modify our data prep a bit:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import text_dataset_from_directory
from tensorflow.strings import regex_replace

def prepareData(dir):
  data = text_dataset_from_directory(dir)
  return data.map(
    lambda text, label: (regex_replace(text, '<br />', ' '), label),
  )

train_data = prepareData('./train')
test_data = prepareData('./test')
```

Now, all `<br />` instances in our dataset have been replaced with spaces. You can try printing some of the dataset if you want:

```python
for text_batch, label_batch in train_data.take(1):
  print(text_batch.numpy()[0])
  print(label_batch.numpy()[0]) # 0 = negative, 1 = positive
```

We're ready to start building our RNN!

## 3. Building the Model

We'll use the [Sequential](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) class, which represents a linear stack of layers. To start, we'll instantiate an empty sequential model and define its input type:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras import Input

model = Sequential()
model.add(Input(shape=(1,), dtype="string"))
```

Our model now takes in 1 string input - time to do something with that string.

### 3.1 Text Vectorization

Our first layer will be a [TextVectorization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing/TextVectorization) layer, which will process the input string and turn it into a sequence of integers, each one representing a token.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization

max_tokens = 1000
max_len = 100
vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(
  # Max vocab size. Any words outside of the max_tokens most common ones
  # will be treated the same way: as "out of vocabulary" (OOV) tokens.
  max_tokens=max_tokens,
  # Output integer indices, one per string token
  output_mode="int",
  # Always pad or truncate to exactly this many tokens
  output_sequence_length=max_len,
)
```

To initialize the layer, we need to call `.adapt()`:

```python
# Call adapt(), which fits the TextVectorization layer to our text dataset.
# This is when the max_tokens most common words (i.e. the vocabulary) are selected.
train_texts = train_data.map(lambda text, label: text)
vectorize_layer.adapt(train_texts)
```

Finally, we can add the layer to our model:

```python
model.add(vectorize_layer)
```

### 3.2 Embedding

Our next layer will be an [Embedding](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding) layer, which will turn the integers produced by the previous layer into fixed-length vectors.


```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding

# Previous layer: TextVectorization
max_tokens = 1000
# ...
model.add(vectorize_layer)

# Note that we're using max_tokens + 1 here, since there's an
# out-of-vocabulary (OOV) token that gets added to the vocab.
model.add(Embedding(max_tokens + 1, 128))
```

> Reading more on popular word embeddings like [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) may help you understand what Embedding layers are and why we use them.

### 3.3 The Recurrent Layer

Finally, we're ready for the recurrent layer that makes our network a RNN! We'll use a Long Short-Term Memory ([LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM)) layer, which is a popular choice for this kind of problem. It's very simple to implement:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM

# 64 is the "units" parameter, which is the
# dimensionality of the output space.
model.add(LSTM(64))
```

To finish off our network, we'll add a standard fully-connected ([Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense)) layer and an output layer with [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) activation:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model.add(Dense(64, activation="relu"))
model.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"))
```

The sigmoid activation outputs a number between 0 and 1, which is perfect for our problem - 0 represents a negative review, and 1 represents a positive one.

## 4. Compiling the Model


Before we can begin training, we need to configure the training process. We decide a few key factors during the compilation step, including:

- The **optimizer**. We'll stick with a pretty good default: the [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) gradient-based optimizer. Keras has [many other optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you can look into as well.
- The **loss function**. Since we only have 2 output classes (positive and negative), we'll use the [Binary Cross-Entropy loss](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/BinaryCrossentropy). [See all Keras losses](https://keras.io/losses/).
- A list of **metrics**. Since this is a classification problem, we'll just have Keras report on the **accuracy** metric.

Here's what that compilation looks like:

```python
model.compile(
  optimizer='adam',
  loss='binary_crossentropy',
  metrics=['accuracy'],
)
```

Onwards!

## 5. Training the Model

Training our model with Keras is super easy:

```python
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10)
```

Putting all the code we've written thus far together and running it gives us results like this:

```
Epoch 1/10
loss: 0.6441 - accuracy: 0.6281
Epoch 2/10
loss: 0.5544 - accuracy: 0.7250
Epoch 3/10
loss: 0.5670 - accuracy: 0.7200
Epoch 4/10
loss: 0.4505 - accuracy: 0.7919
Epoch 5/10
loss: 0.4221 - accuracy: 0.8062
Epoch 6/10
loss: 0.4051 - accuracy: 0.8156
Epoch 7/10
loss: 0.3870 - accuracy: 0.8247
Epoch 8/10
loss: 0.3694 - accuracy: 0.8339
Epoch 9/10
loss: 0.3530 - accuracy: 0.8406
Epoch 10/10
loss: 0.3365 - accuracy: 0.8502
```

We've achieved 85% train accuracy after 10 epochs! There's certainly a lot of room to improve (this problem isn't _that_ easy), but it's not bad for a first effort.

## 6. Using the Model

Now that we have a working, trained model, let's put it to use. The first thing we'll do is save it to disk so we can load it back up anytime:

```python
model.save_weights('cnn.h5')
```

We can now reload the trained model whenever we want by rebuilding it and loading in the saved weights:

```python
model = Sequential()

# ... add the model's layers

# Load the model's saved weights.
model.load_weights('cnn.h5')
```

Using the trained model to make predictions is easy: we pass a string to `predict()` and it outputs a score.

```python
# Should print a very high score like 0.98.
print(model.predict(["i loved it! highly recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for a great movie to watch."]))

# Should print a very low score like 0.01.
print(model.predict(["this was awful! i hated it so much, nobody should watch this. the acting was terrible, the music was terrible, overall it was just bad."]))
```

## 7. Extensions

There's much more we can do to experiment with and improve our network. Some examples of modifications you could make to our CNN include:

### Network Depth

What happens if we add Recurrent layers? How does that affect training and/or the model's final performance?

```python
model = Sequential()

# ...

# Return the full sequence instead of just the last
# output of the sequence.
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)) # highlight-line

# This second recurrent layer's input sequence is the
# output sequence of the previous layer.
model.add(LSTM(64))
```

### Dropout

What if we incorporated **dropout** (e.g. via [Dropout](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout) layers), which is commonly used to prevent overfitting?

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout

model = Sequential()

# ...

# Examples of common ways to use dropout below. These
# parameters are not necessarily the most optimal.
model.add(LSTM(64, dropout=0.25, recurrent_dropout=0.25)) # highlight-line

model.add(Dense(64, activation="relu"))
model.add(Dropout(0.5)) # highlight-line
```

### Text Vectorization Parameters

The `max_tokens` and `max_len` parameters used in our `TextVectorization` layer are natural candidates for tinkering:

- Too low of a `max_tokens` will exclude potentially useful words from our vocabulary, while too high of one may increase the complexity and training time of our model.
- Too low of a `max_len` will impact our model's performance on longer reviews, while too high of one again may increase the complexity and training time of our model.

### Pre-processing

All we did to clean our dataset was remove `<br />` markers. There may be other pre-processing steps that would be useful to us. For example:

- Removing "useless" tokens (e.g. ones that are extremely common or otherwise not useful)
- Fixing common mispellings / abbreviations and standardizing slang
