**Softmax turns arbitrary real values into probabilities**, which are often useful in Machine Learning. The math behind it is pretty simple: given some numbers,

1. Raise [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) (the mathematical constant) to the power of each of those numbers.
2. Sum up all the exponentials (powers of $e$). This result is the *denominator*.
3. Use each number's exponential as its *numerator*.
4. $\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}$.

Written more fancily, Softmax performs the following transform on $n$ numbers $x_1 \ldots x_n$:

$$
s(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}
$$

The outputs of the Softmax transform are always in the range $[0, 1]$ and add up to 1. Hence, they form a **probability distribution**.

## A Simple Example

Say we have the numbers -1, 0, 3, and 5:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Denominator} &= e^{-1} + e^0 + e^3 + e^5 \\
&= \boxed{169.87} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

| $x$ | $e^x$ | Probability ($\frac{e^x}{169.87}$) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -1 | 0.368 | 0.002 |
| 0 | 1 | 0.006 |
| 3 | 20.09 | 0.118 |
| 5 | 148.41 | 0.874 |

The bigger the $x$, the higher its probability. Also, notice that the probabilities all add up to 1, as mentioned before.

## Implementing Softmax in Python

Using [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) makes this super easy:

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(xs):
    return np.exp(xs) / sum(np.exp(xs))

xs = np.array([-1, 0, 3, 5])
print(softmax(xs)) # [0.0021657, 0.00588697, 0.11824302, 0.87370431]
```

## Why is Softmax useful?

Imagine building a [Neural Network](/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) to answer the question: <span class="emph-special">Is this picture of a dog or a cat?</span>

A common design for this neural network would have it output 2 real numbers, one representing _dog_ and the other _cat_, and apply Softmax on these values. For example, let's say the network outputs $[-1, 2]$:

| Animal | $x$ | $e^x$ | Probability |
| - | - | - | - |
| Dog | -1 | 0.368 | 0.047 |
| Cat | 2 | 7.39 | 0.953 |

This means our network is **95.3% confident** that the picture is of a cat. Softmax lets us **answer classification questions with probabilities**, which are more useful than simpler answers (e.g. binary yes/no).
