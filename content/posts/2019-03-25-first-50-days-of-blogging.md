## Why?

I started this blog at the beginning of last month (February 2019) because

- I wanted to become a better writer.
- I felt like I had some interesting/useful things to say.
- I'd [sold both of my main side projects](/about/) and wanted a new challenge.
- I didn't like [the old victorzhou.com](https://github.com/vzhou842/victorzhou.com-old) and had been itching to rewrite it for a while.
- I wanted to learn more about and get firsthand experience with [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).

## The Numbers

On February 4, I published [my first blog post](/blog/better-profanity-detection-with-scikit-learn/) and started my journey. Since then, I've

- Published 6 blog posts.
- Gotten 70k+ pageviews.
- Received 600+ subscribers to [my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=50-days-blogging).

Today is March 25, which is my blog's 50th day! 🎉

Here's a graph of my blog's pageviews since its beginning:

The two spikes are both from my posts reaching the front page of Hacker News: first [my Javascript bug post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19135552) and then [my Neural Networks post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19320217).

Here are all 6 blog posts ranked by number of pageviews:

## Goals for Year One

I'm going to keep blogging! During Year One, I'm aiming to

- Publish 50 blog posts.
- Get a million pageviews.
- Grow [my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=50-days-blogging) to 10,000 subscribers.

Are these goals pretty ambitious? Definitely. I've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do. But I might as well aim high, right?

Anyways - a **huge thank you to my readers** from the past two months! See you all on February 4, 2020 for the Year One recap, where I'll look back at this post and see if I hit my goals. 🎯
